# mantram ðŸ“¿

[mantram.blog](https://mantram.blog/) is a mobile-friendly library/compilation of
various Buddhist mantrams/suttas (çœŸè¨€).

I ([ndinata](https://github.com/ndinata)) built this site so that my family and
friends have an easier time reciting mantrams on their phones. No more having to
zoom in and out of blurry photos of book pages!

All the mantrams are available as Markdown files in [src/content/posts](./src/content/posts/).

For suggestions/corrections feel free to open an issue or email me :)

## tech stack

The site is built with the lovely [Astro](https://astro.build) framework and React + [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) UI components, and is deployed on GitHub Pages.

To run it locally:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/avid-sh/mantram.git
$ cd mantram
$ npm install
$ npm run dev # starts a localhost dev server
```
