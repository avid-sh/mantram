# mantram

[mantram.blog](https://mantram.blog/) is a library/compilation of various Buddhist
mantrams/suttas (真言).

I ([ndinata](https://github.com/ndinata)) built this site so that my family and friends have one central place on which to
find all the mantrams they like to recite. This removes the issue where different
mantrams reside across various books/pictures in the camera roll!

You can find all the available mantrams as Markdown files in [src/content/posts](./src/content/posts/).

For suggestions/corrections feel free to open an issue or email me :)

## tech stack

The site is built with the lovely [Astro](https://astro.build) framework and (React + [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com)) UI components, and is deployed on GitHub Pages.

To run it locally:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/avid-sh/mantram.git
$ cd mantram
$ npm install
$ npm run dev # starts a localhost dev server
```
